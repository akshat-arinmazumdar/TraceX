# TraceX
Security and Surveillance : TRACE X is a smart surveillance system designed to make security faster and more reliable. Imagine a city where cameras not only record but also thinkâ€”instantly detecting number plates and faces in real time. A user simply signs up, uploads or streams footage, and the system quickly scans it, checking against a secure database. If a match is found, like a suspicious vehicle or person, an instant alert is sent to the user. Behind the scenes, TRACE X combines AI-powered detection, smooth user interaction, and a secure database to create a powerful, futuristic tool for safety and monitoring.
